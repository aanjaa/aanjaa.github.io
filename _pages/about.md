Hi! My name is Anja. I am a PhD student in AI at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/) advised by [Prof. Cağlar Gülçehre](https://www.caglarg.com/) and a Student Researcher at [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/). My research interests lie in scientific discovery with AI & LLM cognition.

I was previously an intern at [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kukA0LcAAAAJ&hl=en)'s lab at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en), a visiting student researcher at [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/)'s Lab at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), and an intern at [IBM Research]() in Zurich. I received my master's degree in Neural Systems and Computation from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and my bachelor's degree from the [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/en/university).
